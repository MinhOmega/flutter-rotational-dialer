## Enhancing Security
Traditional password input fields are prone to security vulnerabilities, such as keyloggers or shoulder surfing.

The **Flutter Rotational Password Dialer** not only enhances security but also provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience. The circular interface mimics a combination lock, making it familiar and easy to use. Users can rotate the dialer to select letters, numbers, or symbols, and the selected characters are visually displayed as the user rotates the dialer. This real-time feedback ensures accurate password input and reduces the likelihood of error.

## Additional Features
Beyond its core functionality, the **Flutter Rotational Password Dialer** offers additional features to enhance the overall user experience. These features include:

1. **Customization**: Users can customize the appearance of the dialer, such as color schemes or themes, to suit their preferences and make it visually appealing.
3. **Accessibility**: The dialer is designed to meet accessibility standards, ensuring that users with different abilities can easily and securely input their passwords.
